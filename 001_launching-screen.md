# LAUNCHING-SCREEN
The challengeâ€™s purpose was to make us learn how to launch a new screen through our terminal.

## MY SOLVE
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{4ibHLq62fJLvZcMOyeM0QmOdzur.0VN4IDOxwiN5gjNzEzW}`

### THOUGHT PROCESS/STEPS
In this challenge I had to invoke screen command to open up a new screen. As soon as I was in the screen I hit enter and I was 
given the flag, to exit I had to press ctrl+d.

```bash
~$ screen
[screen is terminating]
```
