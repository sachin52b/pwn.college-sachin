# Removing-files

This challenge expected us to remove a file using rm.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wNW74SoYoQUc7rXR7zuPn9lPdhq.QX2kDM1wiN5gjNzEzW}`

### Thought process
I used rm command to simply remove the file asked which i passed as an argument into it.




```bash
~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{wNW74SoYoQUc7rXR7zuPn9lPdhq.QX2kDM1wiN5gjNzEzW}```
