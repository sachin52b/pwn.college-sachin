# An-epic-filesystem-quest:

Find a hidden layered flag by tracking a series of text-based clues spread across the filesystem. Use ls/ls -a to uncover directory
contents (dotfiles included), and cat to display clue files. Follow clue instrunction â€” trapped  means don't cd (read as full path),
hidden means a dotfile (use ls -a), and delayed means you have to cd prior to the file being readable.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gmMqugWnH3hIrO-UAp8rk0UWmON.QX5IDO0wiN5gjNzEzW}`

### Thought process/Procedure
Treated filesystem like a treasure hunt: read clues carefully, used directory listings to find desired files, and used proper way 
to access each clue based on its instruction. When a clue cautioned against directory changing I read the target by absolute path 
like by directly using cat and path as the argument and if it declared a file to be hidden I listed with -a(ls-a) to show . files 
and when a clue called for stepping into a directory I changed into that directory and read the last file. The focus was on reading
the clue language well and applying ls/ls -a and cat well in order to reach the flag.

The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/arch/mips/include/asm/mach-dec

Watch out! The next clue is **trapped**. You'll need to read it out without 'cd'ing into the directory; otherwise, the clue will self destruct!
