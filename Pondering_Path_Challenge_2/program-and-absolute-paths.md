# Program and absolute paths

This challenge expected us to go in a bit more complicated path and get a file "run " by invoking the exact path

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{I6ZrFlmf75gfFpjY3GIVELxJ8BT.QX1QTN0wiN5gjNzEzW}`

To solve this challenge, I invoke the absolute path `/challenge/run` to execute the file.  
Hereâ€™s what I did in the terminal:

```bash
~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{I6ZrFlmf75gfFpjY3GIVELxJ8BT.QX1QTN0wiN5gjNzEzW}```
