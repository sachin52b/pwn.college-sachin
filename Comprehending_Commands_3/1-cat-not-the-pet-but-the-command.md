# Cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command

This challenge expected us to read a file through cat command. 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gsSitrtDRv86MI3bTUNaNaIaAE2.QXxcTN0wiN5gjNzEzW}`

### Thought process

There wasn't actually much just had to read a file named 'flag' using cat cmd.



```bash
~$ cat flag
pwn.college{gsSitrtDRv86MI3bTUNaNaIaAE2.QXxcTN0wiN5gjNzEzW}```
