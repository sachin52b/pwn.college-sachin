# INTRO TO ARGUMENTS
The challenge accepts us to use an argument with hello

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sj3PUiWMJRmW0glLQRJPdH3kfMJ.QX4YjM1wiN5gjNzEzW}`

we had to type hello and a single argument "hackers" into that which directy gave us the flag


```bash
$ hello hackers
hackers
pwn.college{sj3PUiWMJRmW0glLQRJPdH3kfMJ.QX4YjM1wiN5gjNzEzW}
```
