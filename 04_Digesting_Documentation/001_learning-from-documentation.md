The challenge expected us to use the command with appropriate argument so that I can get the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MRACXmz4RygYiVhuOgKrbWewS6y.QX0ITO0wiN5gjNzEzW}`

### Thought process
The task was really simple and straightforward, the documentation was already provided tat what argument to use
while invoking the command so that we get the flag.


```bash
~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MRACXmz4RygYiVhuOgKrbWewS6y.QX0ITO0wiN5gjNzEzW}```
