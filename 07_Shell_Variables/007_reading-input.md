# Reading Input:
The challengeâ€™s purpose was to make us learn how to read a input something from the user into a variable.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{U2KoBUMwl3OMxroFFpxDvaNmVYl.QX4cTN0wiN5gjNzEzW}`

### Thought process/Steps
I used read var_name to simply let the user input a value into the variable.

 ```bash
read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{U2KoBUMwl3OMxroFFpxDvaNmVYl.QX4cTN0wiN5gjNzEzW}```
