# ZAHARD'S WELCOME
“ The base of Citadel rises before you, its great doors sealed with fractured steel and dead circuitry. Faded corporate protocols 
still hum in the lock, relics of the world that fell. Those who came before tried to climb but all failed. Their echoes linger as 
fragments of voices, reminders of broken attempts to free humanity. Now you have chosen to take their place. You will be the one to 
scale the Citadel and finish what they could not. The voices of the fallen whisper through the static: 
"The path begins in the gathering place. There, candidates are chosen". Here is your invitation. Step into the gathering place where 
all climbers are briefed before the ascent.”

## MY SOLVE
**Flag:** ` citadel{7h3_c174d3l_b3ck0n5}`

### THOUGHT PROCESS/STEPS
In this challenge, we just had to follow a simple clue — the invitation link provided in the description. Once we clicked on it, 
it led us to the discord server, and from there, we explored the sections a bit. Eventually, we headed to the #rules section, and 
that’s where we found the flag waiting for us.
