# THE SOCIAL NETWORK
“The ascent begins. The first floor is not metal or binaries but of memory. Among the echoes, one voice lingers, of an early 
climber. He was among the earliest to challenge the Citadel, and though he failed, his traces remain scattered across the ruins of the 
old world.
It is said that the key to the next floor can be found by tracing the socials of this legendary climber.
Start by checking out citadweller on Instagram.”

## MY SOLVE
**Flag:** ` citadel{17_1s_jus7_7h3_b3g1nn1ng}

### THOUGHT PROCESS/STEPS
In this challenge, we first headed to the Instagram page citadweller, where we found the first part of the flag hidden in one of 
the stories. Along with it, there was another clue that pointed us toward a Twitter page. When we checked there, we discovered 
the second part of the flag. After that, we simply combined both parts — and that gave us the complete flag.
