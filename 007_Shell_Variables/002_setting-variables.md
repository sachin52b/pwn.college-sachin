# Setting-variables
The challenge’s purpose was to make us learn how to assign a value of the variable.

## My solve
**Flag:** `  pwn.college{4dkZK0zsmt7ZdVbw8-us5a7gE49.QX5UTN0wiN5gjNzEzW}} `

### Thought process/Steps
I had to just type a simple command VAR=COLLEGE to assign the value ‘COLLEGE’ to variable VAR.

 ```bash
~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4dkZK0zsmt7ZdVbw8-us5a7gE49.QX5UTN0wiN5gjNzEzW} ```
