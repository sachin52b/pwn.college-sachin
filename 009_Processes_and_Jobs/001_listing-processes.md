# Listing-processes
The challengeâ€™s purpose was to make us learn to list all the processes using the ps cmd. Main uses learnt were ps -ef and ps -aux.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{8NHKFd-ZgfhzfM74ZKwg08Ae-2c.QX4MDO0wiN5gjNzEzW} `

### Thought process/Steps
The steps were simple and straightforward. The question mentioned that we had to run /challenge/run, but the twist was that it 
had been renamed and could only be invoked using its correct name, not /challenge/run. However, it was also stated that the 
program was already running as a process. So, I used ps -ef to list all processes, found the new name of /challenge/run, and then 
invoked it to get the flag.

 ```bash
~$ ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 10:28 ?        00:00:00 /sbin/docker-init -- /nix/var/nix/profiles/dojo-workspace/bin/dojo-init /run/dojo
