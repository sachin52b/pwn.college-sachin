# Intro to Command Challenge
This challenge is an introduction to using the terminal in a pwn.college workspace. The task simply requires typing a command and hit enter. 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YgpfQMrjllAnNe_y6lGYzGt5MYU.QX3YjM1wiN5gjNzEzW}`

The challenge expected me to type `hello` in the terminal and press Enter. The flag was displayed directly.

```bash
$ hello
pwn.college{YgpfQMrjllAnNe_y6lGYzGt5MYU.QX3YjM1wiN5gjNzEzW}
