# Catting-absolute-paths

This challenge expected us to read a file through cat command. 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EMOs0ZTGk7vFvZvTim-73TsHJo4.QX5ETO0wiN5gjNzEzW}`

### Thought process

There wasn't actually much just had to read a file named 'flag' using cat cmd but this time through absolute path(the flag was not directly in home directory but in root directory)



```bash
:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{EMOs0ZTGk7vFvZvTim-73TsHJo4.QX5ETO0wiN5gjNzEzW}```
