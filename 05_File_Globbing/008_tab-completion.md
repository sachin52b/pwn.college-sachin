#Tab-completion
The challenge’s purpose was to learn tab completion.

## My solve
**Flag:** ` pwn.college{E7x8ma4tpoG8g6SKVaqgK3eSee-.0FN0EzNxwiN5gjNzEzW}`

### Thought process/Steps
The steps were basic, I had to use cat command with a particular file whose full name I couldn’t use directly(this was the constraint) 
so I had to press tab on the keyboard for automatic completion.

 ```bash
~$ cat /challenge/pwncollege
pwn.college{E7x8ma4tpoG8g6SKVaqgK3eSee-.0FN0EzNxwiN5gjNzEzW} ```
